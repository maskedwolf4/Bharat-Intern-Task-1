This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning model that predicts house prices. This project was developed as part of Task 1 of the Bharat Intern Virtual Internship.

## House Price Prediction Model - Bharat Intern Virtual Internship Task 1

### Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust and accurate model to estimate the price of a house based on various features like size, location, amenities, and market trends. The project involves the following stages:

* **Data Acquisition and Cleaning:** Utilize a house price dataset from Kaggle and pre-process it to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (house price). This involves data visualization and statistical analysis.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. This might involve one-hot encoding, feature scaling, or domain-specific transformations.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train different machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) on the prepared data. Evaluate and compare their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
* **Deployment and Application:** Save the best performing model and create a Streamlit application to allow users to input house features and receive predicted price estimations.

### Upskilling and Learning Outcomes

This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in various aspects of machine learning:

* **Data Preprocessing and EDA:** I learned techniques for data cleaning, handling missing values, and analyzing data distributions to understand its characteristics.
* **Feature Engineering:** I explored different methods of feature engineering to create more informative features and improve model accuracy.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** I gained practical experience in training and evaluating different machine learning models, selecting the best one based on performance metrics.
* **Streamlit Application Development:** I explored the deployment of machine learning models through building a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time price prediction.

This project significantly boosted my understanding of the complete machine learning pipeline, from data acquisition to model deployment. It allowed me to apply theoretical concepts learned in coursework to a real-world problem, solidifying my knowledge and building valuable practical skills.

### Streamlit Application Usage

To launch the Streamlit application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries (`pip install -r reruirements.txt`).
2. Run the `app.py` file (`streamlit run app.py`).
3. The application will open in your web browser. Enter house features and click "Predict" to receive the estimated price.
